# Handwritten Alphabet CNN

Welcome to Handwritten Alphabet CNN, my final year project for my degree. This project is a mobile app that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for handwritten alphabet recognition.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the mobile app designed to recognize handwritten alphabets using CNN. The app provides a user-friendly interface for capturing handwritten alphabet images and processing them through the trained CNN model.

## Features

- **Handwritten Alphabet Recognition:** The core functionality of the app is to recognize handwritten alphabets accurately.
- **User-friendly Interface:** The mobile app is designed with a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to interact with the application.
- **Convolutional Neural Network:** The project leverages CNN for image classification, ensuring robust and accurate recognition of handwritten alphabets.
